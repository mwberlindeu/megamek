 
This class sets up a random name generator that can then
be used to generate random pilot names. it will have a couple different
settings and flexible input files

Files are located in Data/Names all files are comma-delimited text files.

The masterancestry.txt file shows the correspondence between the different ethnic names and their numeric
code in the database. This file is currently not actually read in by MM, but is provided as a reference. The same
numeric code must be used across all of the files listed below. Currently the numeric codes must be listed in exact
sequential order (i.e. no skipping numbers) for the program to work correctly.

The name database is located in three files: firstname_males.txt, firstname_females.txt, and surnames.txt.
There ar three comma-delimited fields in each of these data files: fld1,fld2,fld3

fld1 - The name itself, either a male/female first name or a surname.
fld2 - a frequency weight to account for some names being more common than others. Currently this is not being used.
fld3 - the numeric code identifying the "ethnic" group this name belongs to.

Faction files are located in Data/Names/factions.

The name that is given before ".txt" is used as the key for the faction.
The faction files will have varying number of fields depending on how many ethnic groups exist. The faction file does two things. First, it identifies
the relative frequency of different ethnic surnames for a faction.

Second, it identifies the correspondence between first names and surnames. This allows, for example, for more Japanese first names regardless of surname
in the Draconis Combine. There should be a line in the Faction file for each ethnic group.

fld1 - the id for the ethnic group
fld2 - the ethnic group name. Not currently read in, just for easy reference.
fld3 - The relative frequency of this ethnic surname in the faction.
fld4-fldn - These fields identify the relative frequency of first names from an ethnic group given the surname listed in fld1.
